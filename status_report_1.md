## Retrospective
### What worked
* Tasks for the sprint were equally divided and were easy to complete.
* Tasks were easily trackable using github project.
* Good learning setting up the continous integration pipeline.

### Want didn't work

### What are you going to do differently
* Analyze and research about the tasks before the sprint starts to have more accurate estimates.
